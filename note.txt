task 1: predict travel time  (enter into intersection in time window)

 t_A_2  enter south
 t_A_3  enter north
 t_B_1  enter south
 t_B_3  enter north
 t_C_1  enter south
 t_C_3  enter north

 model travel time

 t = t_run + t_wait_before_tollgate

 t_run = f(flux_density,weather)
 flux_density = h(flux,num_lane)
 t_wait_before_tollgate = g(tollgate_waiting_volume(t-1),route_flux,tollgate_entry_velocity)


task 2: predict tollgate volume

 tollgate_1 out
 tollgate_1 in
 tollgate_2 in
 tollgate_3 in
 tollgate_3 out

 volume in model

 volume_in tollgate 1 = route_flux C_1 + route_flux B_1 + tollgate_waiting_volume(t-1) - tollgate_waiting_volume(t)
 volume_in tollgate 2 = route_flux A_2 + tollgate_waiting_volume(t-1) - tollgate_waiting_volume(t)
 volume_in tollgate 3 = route_flux A_3 + route_flux B_3 + route_flux C_3 + tollgate_waiting_volume(t-1) - tollgate_waiting_volume(t)

 volume_out tollgate 1 = high way north out flux
 volume_out tollgate 3 = high way south out flux


   thinking method:

   1,
   calculating flux for each route first (cause it is a obvious feature)
   maybe different part in volume too ...

   2,
   use model regression based on vehicle flux (here it seems difficult to combine table 5and table 6, if we can do this, it will better)
   so maybe different model......
